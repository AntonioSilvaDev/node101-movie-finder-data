# Hey There :wave:

In this project, we are making an *axios* call to the OMDB website to acquire movie data.  The user will either give an I parameter, for a valid IMDB ID, or a T parameter, a movie title, in the URL.  We will then cache the results to ensure we do not hit the database again for repeat searches, saving resources.

To get started, open the app in VS code, or code editor of your choosing, and install the dependencies via the terminal by typing '$ npm install'. Next, in the terminal, type '$ node server/index.js' to start the app on the local node server and open the localhost:3000 in the browser of your choice.  To search using IMDB ID, use *localhost:3000/?i="enter ID here"*.  To search using Movie Title, use *localhost:3000/?t="enter movie title here"*.

## ENJOY! :thumbsup:
